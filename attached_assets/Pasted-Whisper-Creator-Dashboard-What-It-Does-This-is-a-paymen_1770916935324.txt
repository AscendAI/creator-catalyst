Whisper Creator Dashboard — What It Does

This is a payment management system for UGC (user-generated content) creators who post short-form videos across three platforms: Instagram Reels, TikTok, and YouTube Shorts.

Core flow:

Admins add creators to the system and link their social media usernames (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube).
The system syncs video data from those platforms — pulling in each video's views, likes, comments, duration, and thumbnail.
Videos are automatically paired across platforms. A video on Instagram gets matched to the same video on TikTok by comparing durations within a 36-hour posting window. YouTube Shorts are optional.
Creators get paid based on 2-week payout cycles. Pay includes:
Base pay per paired video (configurable per platform, with optional per-creator custom rates)
View bonuses when videos hit milestone thresholds (e.g., 10K views, 50K views)
Only eligible videos count — they must not be marked irrelevant, and must be posted on or after the creator's join date.
There are also Bounties (one-off challenges with rewards/penalties) and Streak Survivor (a game where creators must post daily to stay alive and split a prize pool).
How ScrapeCreators Works

ScrapeCreators is a third-party API service that fetches public video data from social platforms. The dashboard uses it as the primary data source.

API endpoints used:

TikTok: GET /v3/tiktok/profile/videos — pass a TikTok username, get back their recent videos with views, likes, comments, duration, thumbnail, and post date.
Instagram: GET /v1/instagram/user/reels — pass an Instagram username, get back their reels with the same metrics.
YouTube: GET /v1/youtube/channel/shorts — pass a YouTube channel handle, get back Shorts under 60 seconds with metrics.
How syncing works:

The system sends requests to ScrapeCreators with the creator's username for each platform.
It receives back an array of video objects with metrics.
Before saving new data, it deletes old video records for that creator (while preserving any manual engagement notes).
The fresh video data is inserted into the database.
After sync, the system runs milestone detection, updates survivor game stats, and saves stats snapshots.
Creators can self-sync up to 3 times per day. Admins can sync any creator or all creators at once with no limit.
Authentication: All ScrapeCreators API calls include the SCRAPECREATORS_API_KEY in the request headers.
